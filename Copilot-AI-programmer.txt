I want to test the GitHub copilot (https://copilot.github.com/, https://github.com/features/copilot/signup).
I am not a Visual Studio user, I can't use it.
However, I am interested in it. I checked some youtube videos explaining it.

How well does Copilot handle scripting in Python, Nodejs, and Bash?

The result is impressive. The AI copilot can suggest codes and comments from just a small chunk of words.
Obviously, it is not for a beginner but for a programmer who has already the experience to revise and check the code.
